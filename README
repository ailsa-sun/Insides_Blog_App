Hi There! This is a project I'm probably going to work on, on and off over the next year or so. Basically, I'm going to try to create my own internal blogging software. This is not for lack of otherwise fantastic
software out there. I used Google Blogger for a long time, and still love it. It's mostly for my own educational purposes and a decent amount of obstinate hubiris (I would like to say that I created all my web content
from scratch). 

Thanks for visiting, and I hope we'll see this project grow!
